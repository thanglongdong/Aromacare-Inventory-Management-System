    <h2><?= __('Our World Of Aromas') ?></h2>
    <p>We all know the delight of a walk in the garden or bush – the smell of roses, of orange blossom and geranium leaves or of lavender flowers rubbed through fingers, the intense scent of eucalyptus gum leaves, of basil, and the aromas of rosemary and new mown grass. These plants’ aromas and myriads of others are derived from their essential oils. It is these pure plant oils that form the foundation for aromatherapy’s health and healing practices and Aromacare’s products.<p>
